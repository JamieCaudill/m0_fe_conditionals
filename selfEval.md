# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel good, and with more practice I will feel great. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Same as above.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Same as above.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
An hour. I thought at first that it was just one file, so I took my time. Then I realized it was 4 files, so I had to ramp up the pace a bit.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to practice pushing things to github. I didn't do that until the very end of the conditionals assignment, and then wasn't sure if I needed an "Initial commit" at the beginning of each assignment. I'm going to practice the other two code challenges later today. I shouldn't need to unless the other assignments take longer than I anticipate.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Do I need to have an "Initial commit" at the beginning of every assignment? I will google it.
